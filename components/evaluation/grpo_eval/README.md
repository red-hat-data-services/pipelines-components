# Grpo Eval ✨

> ⚠️ **Stability: alpha** — This asset is not yet stable and may change.

## Overview 🧾

Evaluate GRPO training results from the shared pipeline workspace.

Reads ART's ``training_results.json`` from the caller-provided shared-PVC path. The GRPO pipeline supplies ``{workspace_path}/checkpoints/training_results.json``, while the complete path input keeps the component independent of the PVC mount location.

Required JSON fields are ``final_mean_reward``, ``reward_history``, ``full_match_history``, and ``timing_history``. The final reward and every history entry must be a finite number. Reward and full-match histories must have the same number of iterations. The logged ``mean_reward`` is ART's reported
final aggregate reward, while ``final_reward`` is the last entry in ``reward_history`` used for the promotion comparison.

## Inputs 📥

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `training_results_path` | `str` | `None` | Mounted path to ART's ``checkpoints/training_results.json`` file. |
| `output_metrics` | `dsl.Output[dsl.Metrics]` | `None` | KFP Metrics artifact receiving the GRPO scalar metrics. |
| `output_reward_chart` | `dsl.Output[dsl.HTML]` | `None` | KFP HTML artifact containing mean reward by training iteration. |

## Outputs 📤

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Output | `NamedTuple('GrpoEvalOutputs', [('promotion_passed', bool)])` | Named output ``promotion_passed``. It is true only when the final reward is strictly greater than the initial reward. A single reward value does not demonstrate improvement and returns false. |

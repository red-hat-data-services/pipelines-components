"""AutoGluon callbacks that stream live per-model runs to MLflow.

Callbacks are a Tabular-only, developer-facing AutoGluon feature (added in 1.2.0). They
fire during ``TabularPredictor.fit()`` after each *candidate* model is trained on the
internal validation split -- before leaderboard ranking, top-N selection, or the full
refit. This callback turns each of those events into a **live MLflow child run**: as soon
as a model finishes training, a nested run appears under the parent with its validation
score, so the experiment fills in model-by-model while ``fit()`` is still running.

The end-of-run refit loop (in
:class:`~kfp_components.components.training.automl.shared.mlflow_tracking.MlflowExperimentLogger`)
then *enriches* -- rather than duplicates -- these runs: it reuses the child run created
here (matched by model name via a shared ``registry``) and adds the authoritative test
metrics and artifacts. Once the top-N are selected, the refit loop calls
``prune_live_child_runs`` to delete the live child runs of candidates that did not make the
cut, so only the refit-and-enriched top-N models remain under the parent.

``TimeSeriesPredictor`` has no equivalent callback system, so this module is used only by
the tabular training component.

Everything here is best-effort: a missing callback API, an unreadable trainer attribute,
or an MLflow error is swallowed so training is never affected.

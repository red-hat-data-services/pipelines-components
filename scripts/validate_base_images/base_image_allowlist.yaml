# Base image allowlist for scripts/validate_base_images/validate_base_images.py
#
# This file defines non-ghcr.io/kubeflow base images that are permitted when
# validating components/pipelines. If an image does not start with
# "ghcr.io/kubeflow/" and does not match this allowlist, validation will fail.
#
# Keep patterns anchored (use ^ and $) where possible to avoid overly-broad
# matches.
#
# Schema:
# - allowed_images: exact image strings
# - allowed_image_patterns: list of regex patterns matched against the full image
allowed_images:
  - 'quay.io/opendatahub/odh-training-th04-cpu-torch29-py312-rhel9:latest-cpu'
  - 'registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-311:latest'
allowed_image_patterns:
  - '^python:\d+\.\d+.*$'
